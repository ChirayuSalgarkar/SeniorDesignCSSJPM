If you have installed PlatformIO extensions into VSCode, then you will not be able to see the pio or platformio commands in a shell outside of VSCode.

In addition, if you use VSCodeâ€™s Terminal->New Terminal option, the commands will not be available there either!

To use them, Click on the PlatformIo icon on the left side toolbar (Ant/Alien head), then in the Quick Access list that appears, under Miscellaneous, choose New Terminal.

Now you should be able to use the commands.

My best advice is to follow the instructions at Redirecting... 888 to add the pio and platformio commands to your normal shell/command line sessions. That way, every terminal you open, inside or outside of VSCode, will have the commands available.
